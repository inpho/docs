# Project Ideas
This details projects that may be appropriate for someone new to the project or
for further research questions.

## Corpus size examination
PhilPapers only has abstracts, SEP has articles, HathiTrust has books. We need
an examination of the scalability of various NLP techniques.

We should also model just the introductory sections of the SEP articles to see
how that changes things wrt PhilPapers.  Brent has been working on getting a
handle on how procrustes analysis matches up between different sources -- see
most recent blog post.

To approach this, we ned someone to extract the SEP intros as another corpus and
then doing the same analysis as the most recent blog post, but with PhilPapers,
SEP intros, and SEP fulltext?
